<h1> Chapter 2:  Some Thoughts </h1>
<p> 
One of the messages I took away from reading Chapter 2 of the Pragmatic Programmer was the importance of not repeating onself. 
My first reaction to reading this was "Oh boy, this again?" because this seems like a message that has been hammered into my head several times.  In fact,
just today in CS 335, Mikey was talking about the importance of not repeating oneself.  But despite having this message seemingly ingrained in my head,
I still manage to repeat myself in my code from time to time.  </p>

<p>
It was nice to look at some of the reasons coders repeate themselves, and I definitely identified with a couple.  Primarily, if I ever duplicate code, it is
usually because a result of either being impatient or simply being inadvertent.  Sometimes, I simply don't understand what I'm doing.  In fact, this happens
to me many times, as a student still learning how to code.  Therefore, I may think I need to write the same code twice in order to accomplish something,
but this is rarely ever true.  Also as part of being a student, sometimes I only know one way to do something.  If I can figure out something that works in my code,
you can sure bet I'm gonna milk it for as long as I can, even if it's redundant.  Is it lazy?  Yep. But I might not know how to utilize what I've already written,
so instead, I turn to simply writing my code again.  I can remember specifically that some of my projects in 180 and 220 featured a lot of duplication, usually
due to a mixture of both indadvertent and impatient coding. <p>
