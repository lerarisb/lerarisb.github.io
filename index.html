<h1> Ch 1:  My reactions </h1>

<p> One of the things in Chapter 1 that stood out to me was the importance of
a programmer accepting responsiblity.  Obviously, it is hard for anyone to 
accept whenever they make a mistake or screw up, and I also struggle to do this.Therefore, as a programmer, it is crucial that I ensure I admit when I make a
mistake.  </p>

<p> Something else that also stood out to me was the "Broken Windows Metaphor."  This metaphor simply explains that if you start by dealing with smaller problems as they arise, such as cleaning up a broken window, you can avoid bigger problems down the line, such as run down and uninhabited neighborhoods.  This same 
principle applies to coding.  If you know you make a mistake, write poor code, etc, you will be much better suited if you address the problem initially, instead of leaving it be.  I know this will be a challenge for me.  Sometimes, it's easier for me to finish a project in a big picture sense before going back to refine the details.  But with programming, it's clear it needs to be the other way around, no matter how much of a struggle it is. </p>

<h1> Chapter 2:  Some Thoughts </h1>
<p> 
One of the messages I took away from reading Chapter 2 of the Pragmatic Programmer was the importance of not repeating onself. 
My first reaction to reading this was "Oh boy, this again?" because this seems like a message that has been hammered into my head several times.  In fact,
just today in CS 335, Mikey was talking about the importance of not repeating oneself.  But despite having this message seemingly ingrained in my head,
I still manage to repeat myself in my code from time to time.  </p>

<p>
It was nice to look at some of the reasons coders repeate themselves, and I definitely identified with a couple.  Primarily, if I ever duplicate code, it is
usually because a result of either being impatient or simply being inadvertent.  Sometimes, I simply don't understand what I'm doing.  In fact, this happens
to me many times, as a student still learning how to code.  Therefore, I may think I need to write the same code twice in order to accomplish something,
but this is rarely ever true.  Also as part of being a student, sometimes I only know one way to do something.  If I can figure out something that works in my code,
you can sure bet I'm gonna milk it for as long as I can, even if it's redundant.  Is it lazy?  Yep. But I might not know how to utilize what I've already written,
so instead, I turn to simply writing my code again.  I can remember specifically that some of my projects in 180 and 220 featured a lot of duplication, usually
due to a mixture of both indadvertent and impatient coding. <p>
