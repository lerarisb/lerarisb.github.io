<p> One of the things in Chapter 1 that stood out to me was the importance of
a programmer accepting responsiblity.  Obviously, it is hard for anyone to 
accept whenever they make a mistake or screw up, and I also struggle to do this.Therefore, as a programmer, it is crucial that I ensure I admit when I make a
mistake.  </p>

<p> Something else that also stood out to me was the "Broken Windows Metaphor."  This metaphor simply explains that if you start by dealing with smaller problems as they arise, such as cleaning up a broken window, you can avoid bigger problems down the line, such as run down and uninhabited neighborhoods.  This same 
principle applies to coding.  If you know you make a mistake, write poor code, etc, you will be much better suited if you address the problem initially, instead of leaving it be.  I know this will be a challenge for me.  Sometimes, it's easier for me to finish a project in a big picture sense before going back to refine the details.  But with programming, it's clear it needs to be the other way around, no matter how much of a struggle it is. </p>
